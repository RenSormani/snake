# snake
As part of the JavaScript fundamentals module I was charged with creating a fully-functional game using everything I had learned across all the modules to date. I chose to develop the classic game Snake, incorporating everything I'd learned about functions, classes and keypresses in the JavaScript module, as well as giving it a more aesthetically pleasing design than your classic Nokia 8830 game, courtesy of the CSS knowledge I'd garnered earlier in the course. So, without further ado, I present my version of Snake... Feed the Snake!
